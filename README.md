# KDEhentai
## Why the name?
It is meant to meme how there is the subreddit r/unixporn and considering that for the most part I only use KDE, why not meme on the unixporn subreddit and lean into it with KDE (replacing unix) and hentai rather than porn as I am a weeb.

## What is this repo?
This repo is meant to share the themes different themes I use and make in KDE. 

## KDE file paths
- Global theme: /.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme
- Colors: /.local/share/color-schemes
- Window decoration: /.local/share/aurorae/themes
- Splash screen: /.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel
- Widgets: /.local/share/plasma/plasmoids

These paths may need to be used as some of my rices will include custom files or files which I am not too sure where it came from (such as ArchSmooth). If you (or you know who) own(s) any of these, I will add your repo in theme breakdown section.
