Has many of the widgets used in default theme but spread accross to fill space and make the top bar more clean.

## My thoughts on this theme
Probs will use this for quite a while and see how it goes. I think this is much more cleaner compared to my default theme. One downside is latte dock sometimes uses a lot of memory (not sure why) around 700 MB at one point. It probably is one of the widgets having a memory leak.
